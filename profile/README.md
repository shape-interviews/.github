## üé° Process

The technical interview process includes a take-home assignment and a follow-up in-person or remote interview. In the take-home assignment ‚Äì with a problem provided by us and completed by you within your own time frame ‚Äì you will be able to demonstrate your skills, understanding of the subject, and ability to deliver a working solution. After that, we will invite you for a face-to-face interview where we will have a more in-depth discussion about your approach, your solutions, and the tradeoffs you have considered, as well as evaluate your communication and teamwork.

To help you prepare for your interview, this section describes what to expect before, during, and after the interview.
