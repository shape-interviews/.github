Who are you? Let‚Äôs find out.

## üé° Process

Our technical interview process includes a take-home assignment and a follow-up in-person or remote interview. In the take-home assignment ‚Äì with a problem provided by us and completed by you within your own time frame ‚Äì you will be able to demonstrate your skills, understanding of the subject, and ability to deliver a working solution. But we also want to talk to you in person, so after that, we will invite you for a face-to-face interview where we will have a more in-depth discussion about your approach, your solutions, and the tradeoffs you have considered, as well as evaluate your communication skills and teamwork ability.

Don‚Äôt worry. To help you prepare for your interview, this section describes what to expect before, during, and after the interview.

### üßò‚Äç‚ôÄ Before the interview

- Send an e-mail to our Talent Acquisition Manager, indicating an estimated time frame for completing the assignment.
- Complete the assignment and push your solution to this repository you were invited to.
- Prepare a list of any questions you may have about Framna for the follow-up interview, particularly regarding the technical team and its processes.
- Our Talent Acquisition Manager will schedule the interview based on your estimated completion time for the take-home assignment.
- We will review your solution and use it as a basis for questions and discussion topics for the interview.

### ü™ë During the interview

Typically the interview process will last approximately 1 hour, with the following time allocation:

> **üí° Tip**
> 
> If you‚Äôre doing the interview remotely, make sure to bring a glass of water üö∞ or a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. You will be doing a lot of the talking so it will be a good idea to have something to drink. We will make sure to bring you a drink, if you're visiting us here at the office. üòä

- **Introductions** (approx. 5 minutes): Here we will introduce ourselves and briefly explain the interview structure. You will also have the opportunity to introduce yourself, provide a brief overview of your background, experience, and what motivated you to apply for this position.

- **Assignment Walkthrough** (approx. 10 minutes): You will present your solution to the take-home assignment, including any technical highlights. We will also want to see a live demonstration of the application from a phone or an emulator. So please ensure that you bring your own laptop for this portion of the interview unless otherwise agreed upon beforehand. If you are joining remotely, please test that you can join and share your screen in Google Meet.

- **Technical Discussion and Questions** (approx. 30 minutes): Now we will lead a discussion around your solution and start asking relevant technical questions to gain a deeper understanding of your skills and experience.

- **Your Questions about Framna** (approx. 10 minutes): You will then have an opportunity to ask questions about our tech stack, culture, workflows, and whatever else you may be curious about.

- **Next Steps & Goodbye** (approx. 5 minutes): At the end we will provide an overview of the next steps and say goodbye. If you‚Äôre visiting us at the office, we might also show you around.

### üåà After the interview

- Our TAM will inform you of the next steps in the hiring process, whether that be moving forward or not to additional interviews, requesting further information, or extending an offer of employment.
- Please follow up with us regarding any change to the status of your application or if you have any further questions.

## üß© Criteria

Now we will describe the criteria we use when evaluating applicants for technical roles here at Framna. We will focus on four key areas during the evaluation process:

- **Communication** is key. During a meeting with clients or sending an e-mail - we need to be able to understand your ideas and thoughts clearly. This includes both technical communication, such as the ability to explain the trade-offs behind a technical decision, as well as general communication skills. Understanding the perspectives of others and being able to provide feedback are also very important qualities.

- **Technical level**: Swift, Kotlin, .NET - are you passionate about any of them? Good! We value proficiency in specific programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, as well as your problem-solving abilities, and your understanding of technical concepts and best practices.

- **Product Mindset**: How does the product work? How is it used? And how do we improve it? We expect our colleagues at Framna to understand and think critically about how their work will impact the product and of course the user experience.

- We value effective **Collaboration**. Remember the important communication skills? Giving constructive feedback is great, and receiving it well is even better. We all work in different ways, so the ability to adapt to different working styles, and the ability to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds, roles, and responsibilities is important for successful collaborations.
